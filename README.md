Due to the recent growth of competition in the market, RetailGiant wants to do an analysis on all of their sales data since 
their inception in 2015 to find out what works best for them. They want to become more efficient in order to keep a leg up

## Data Structure

## Methodology
I received the data as an Excel Workbook where all of the tables are in their own tab, and I converted each table to its
own UTF8 CSV file in order to ingest it into the PostgresQL database. The data was manipulated with complex queries, and
the query results were made into views. The views were used to create the relevant data visualizations in Excel to
support my findings.
